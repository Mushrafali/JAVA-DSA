# Java and Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Mastery

Key Learning Outcomes:

(1) Java Programming:

Basics: Understanding Java syntax and structure. Writing and executing basic Java programs. Mastery of variables, data types, operators, and control structures. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Deep dive into classes and objects. Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Working with interfaces and abstract classes. Advanced Concepts: Exception handling and debugging. File I/O and serialization. Multithreading and concurrency. Java collections framework. Introduction to Java streams and lambda expressions. Java Tools and Ecosystem: Setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Understanding the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Overview of popular Java libraries and frameworks.

(2) Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):

Fundamentals: Introduction to algorithms and their complexity analysis (Big O notation). Basics of data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Advanced Data Structures: Trees (binary trees, AVL trees, B-trees). Graphs and graph algorithms. Hash tables and hashing techniques. Heaps and priority queues. Algorithms: Sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, etc.). Searching algorithms (binary search, depth-first search, breadth-first search, etc.). Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. Recursion and backtracking. Practical Applications: Implementing real-world problems using data structures and algorithms. Optimization techniques and problem-solving strategies. Competitive programming and coding challenges preparation.

Projects and Assessments:
Development of multiple Java applications demonstrating OOP principles. Implementation of various data structures and algorithms. Participation in coding challenges and hackathons. Final capstone project integrating Java and DSA concepts to solve a complex problem.
